# Image Segmentation

In this project, we use the "Random Walker Algorithm" to segment the image. It is finally compared with the inbuilt function.

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to implement image segmentation algorithm using Random walker. The implementation is done following the research paper based on "Random Walks for Image Segmentation" by L.Grady.

## Dataset
There are ten different Grayscale images. all are of dimension 128 * 128 * 4 and in the '.png' format.

## Technologies
The project uses Python >= 3.5

Other technologies and libraries used
* Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
* OpenCV
* Pillow
* Numpy
* Math
* Matplotlib
* Skimage
